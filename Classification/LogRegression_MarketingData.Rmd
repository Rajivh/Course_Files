A Portuguese banking institution is interested in unleashing a marketing campaign for the subscription of its term deposits. The marketing campaign will be focussed towards the existing customers of the banking institution. The bank does have historical data of its customers encompassing a wide range of attributes (Client information, previous cam-paign and other socio economic attributes). 

In the interest of spending money judiciously, the bank would like to know beforehand the possibility of a customer subscribing to its term deposit. With this knowledge, the bank can target a select pool of customers, thereby reducing its marketing campaign ex-penses and at the same time getting a higher conversion ratio (Number of customers sub-scribing to the term deposit over the number of customers contacted).

Armed with the historical data about the bankâ€™s clients and the previous marketing cam-paigns, the objective is to develop a Classification (Logistic Regression) algorithm which would predict if a customer would or would not subscribe to a term deposit. Thus, this would be a binary (yes/no) classification problem with 20 predictor variables to start with.
